## Text Macros

Text macros are a powerful tool that can save you a lot of time when creating documents. They allow you to define reusable pieces of text that can be inserted into your document by using a simple syntax.

Using text macros is easy. Here's how you can get started:

### Example

For example, I have a paragraph, but there are something is dynamic, so I want to use a macro to replace it.

```markdown
<span class="text blur">My First Blog Post</span> was created on Sat, 25 Mar 2023 15:26:37 GMT. 
```

In this example, the text `My First Blog Post` and the date `Sat, 25 Mar 2023 15:26:37 GMT` are dynamic, so I want to use a macro to replace them.

```markdown
[[ #blur($title) ]] was created on [[ #dayjs($created).format("MMMMDD, YYYY") ]]. 
```

### Syntax
